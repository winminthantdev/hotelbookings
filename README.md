# Hotel & Room Management System (Frontend)

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)

This repository contains the frontend for a modern and responsive room management system. It is built entirely with **React** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**.

**Important Note:** Currently, this is a **frontend-only** application. All data is static and loaded from local dummy files for demonstration purposes. The goal is to showcase the user interface and user experience before connecting it to a live backend API.

A responsive and modern web application designed for property owners to efficiently manage their room listings. This project features a powerful owner-facing dashboard to add new rooms, view all listings, and update room availability in real-time.

**Live Demo:** [Demo](https://quickstaywithus.onrender.com)

## üîÆ Future Goals (Roadmap)

The vision for this project is to evolve it into a full-stack application. The next steps include:
* [ ] **Build a REST API**: Develop a backend server using Node.js and Express.js to manage data.
* [ ] **Integrate a Database**: Use a database like MongoDB to store room, user, and booking information persistently.
* [ ] **Connect Frontend to API**: Replace the static dummy data with live data fetched from the new API.
* [ ] **Implement User Authentication**: Add login and registration functionality for both admins and guests.
